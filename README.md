Commoditizing how elevator works - algorithm to make how elevators move in a setup

Elevators generally have proprietory hardware and their own algorithm how movement of the cart would be. This creates problem at lot of places where people feel elevator movement are not appropriate or plain naive. Considering the current enviornment where almost all buidings have multiple elevators and their needs are varying in terms of utilization of the elevator, peak times, load factors.

Commoditizing this algorithm will lead into a proper utilization of the elevators which will facilitate to help people.

The target of this is only to instruct elevator cart movement; not to touch the core hardware of elevator movement.

**Features**:
1. Customizable elevator group design and floors where people can on-board/off-board from the elevators.
2. Movement direction to be given to elevator upon receiving input requests (people press buttons to call the elevator).
3. Output in terms of instruction to elevator hardware to move and serve (and its direction).
4. Observe the patterns of load and timing for the particular setup and utilize the same in movement of elevators.
5. Have a mechanism to move elevators prior to user request; intuitive load sensing or requirement sensing.
